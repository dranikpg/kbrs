History
On May 25, 2006,[2] the former Louisville, New Albany & Corydon Railroad was sold by its then owner, BPM Rail, Inc., to the line's main customer, Lucas Oil. The line is now owned by a subsidiary of that company, Lucas Rail Lines, Inc. (LRL)[3] and does business as Lucas Oil Rail Line (LNAL). NOTE: The correct reporting marks are LNAL - There are no LORL reporting marks in the Official Railway Equipment Register or railroad reporting marks database.
